/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call. */

// BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

// BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
// BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

// const poll = {
//   question: 'What is your favourite programming language?',
//   options: ['0: JavaScript', '1: Python', '2: Rust', '3: C++'],
//   answers: [0, 0, 0, 0],
//   registerNewAnswer() {
//     //Get answer
//     const answer = Number(
//       prompt(
//         `${this.question}\n${this.options.join(
//           '\n'
//         )}\n(Write option number below)`
//       )
//     );
//     console.log(answer);

//     //Register answer
//     typeof answer === 'number' && !!answer && answer < this.answers.length
//       ? this.answers[answer]++
//       : alert('Try again');
//     this.displayResults();
//     this.displayResults('string');
//   },

//   displayResults(type = 'array') {
//     if (type === 'array') {
//       console.log(this.answers);
//     } else if (type === 'string') {
//       console.log(`Poll results are ${this.answers.join(', ')}`);
//     }
//   },
// };

// document
//   .querySelector('.poll')
//   .addEventListener('click', poll.registerNewAnswer.bind(poll));

// poll.displayResults.call({ answers: [5, 2, 3] }, 'string');
// poll.displayResults.call({ answers: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1] }, 'string');
// poll.displayResults.call({ answers: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1] });

// Coding Challenge 2
// Explain why this function works?
(function () {
  const header = document.querySelector('h1');
  header.style.color = 'red';

  document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function () {
    header.style.color = 'blue';
  });
})();
//
/* Here the closure is necessary because by the time the callback function (event handler) is executed, the execution context of the IIFE would have been gone already. The callback function is attached to the body element, and it's waiting for some events to happen there. When the event happens, it will be executed, even though the environment in which it was created is already gone.
However, here it is still able to access the variables that were created in that variable environment by the time the function was born. So the IIFE is the birthplace of the event handler function, therefore the function remembers all the variables present at a time of it's birth, and it is able to use them all */
