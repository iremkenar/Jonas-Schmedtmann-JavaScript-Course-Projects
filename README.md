## Pig Game
[Play here!](https://j4pu8n.csb.app/) 
Pig Game is a two-player game where players take turns rolling a dice. 
The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points by accumulating the sum of each dice roll. 
However, players must be careful as a roll of 1 will result in the loss of their entire accumulated score. 
Players must weigh the risk of rolling again against the potential reward of holding onto their current score and passing the turn to their opponent.
